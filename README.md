# Mastermind

## Overview
This is a Python implementation of the classic code-breaker game called Mastermind. The goal is to correctly guess the secret combindation of a
randomly-generated color seequence within the alloted amount of attempts. After each guess, the player will be given clues that will indicate whether 
they chose a correct color or, better yet, a correct color and its correct location within the sequence. 

It'll take logical thinking and a little bit of luck to crack the secret combindation!
